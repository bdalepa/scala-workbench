# Demo Notebooks
There are a series of demo notebooks located in the demos directory.  To use the demos, simply drag and drop them onto your workbench then run the application.  The demo may need to be modified before use, but each demo will have instructions on what needs to be modified.

The following are examples of files you might wish to download:

*  imsudb.jar -> You can find this IMS™ Universal driver in, for example, ```/usr/lpp/ims/ims13/imsjava/imsudb.jar```
